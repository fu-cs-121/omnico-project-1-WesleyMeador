# Omnico Project 1 Evaluation for Wesley Meador

### Python Script and Requirements

- Your implementation in `main.py` successfully reads the CSV file, converts the values to integers, and updates the dictionary with the total happiness, total duration, and session count for each algorithm.
- You correctly calculate the average happiness and average session duration for each algorithm and determine which algorithm has the highest average happiness rating and the longest average session duration.
- The printed report closely follows the provided example output, clearly showing averages, session counts, and the top-performing algorithms.

### Report File

- Your `report.md` is comprehensive and well organized. It properly describes the methodology, presents detailed results, and includes thoughtful observationsâ€”such as the ethical considerations regarding the DeepPulse algorithm.
- The report clearly communicates your steps and conclusions in a professional format as required by the assignment.

### Overall Feedback

- Excellent job meeting all the project requirements. Your code is functional, and your report demonstrates a clear understanding of file I/O, data processing, and reporting.
- One minor suggestion: although your code recalculates averages in the printing loop (which is acceptable for this assignment), you could simplify it by using the already-computed values from your earlier loops. This is just a refinement, as the current implementation works perfectly.
